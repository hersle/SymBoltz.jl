  abstract = {We present a state-of-the-art primordial recombination code, HyRec, including all the physical effects that have been shown to significantly affect recombination. The computation of helium recombination includes simple analytic treatments of hydrogen continuum opacity in the He I 2 1P - 1 1S line, the He I] 2 3P - 1 1S line, and treats feedback between these lines within the on-the-spot approximation. Hydrogen recombination is computed using the effective multilevel atom method, virtually accounting for an infinite number of excited states. We account for two-photon transitions from 2s and higher levels as well as frequency diffusion in Lyman-alpha with a full radiative transfer calculation. We present a new method to evolve the radiation field simultaneously with the level populations and the free electron fraction. These computations are sped up by taking advantage of the particular sparseness pattern of the equations describing the radiative transfer. The computation time for a full recombination history is {\textasciitilde}2 seconds. This makes our code well suited for inclusion in Monte Carlo Markov chains for cosmological parameter estimation from upcoming high-precision cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements.},

  abstract = {Euclid is a European Space Agency medium class mission selected for launch in 2019 within the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme. The main goal of Euclid is to understand the origin of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Euclid will explore the expansion history of the Universe and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis. This review has been planned and carried out within Euclid's Theory Working Group and is meant to provide a guide to the scientific themes that will underlie the activity of the group during the preparation of the Euclid mission.},

  abstract = {Angular statistics of cosmological observables are hard to compute. The main difficulty is due to the presence of highly-oscillatory Bessel functions which need to be integrated over. In this paper, we provide a simple and fast method to compute the angular power spectrum and bispectrum of any observable. The method is based on using an FFTlog algorithm to decompose the momentumspace statistics onto a basis of power-law functions. For each power law, the integrals over Bessel functions have a simple analytical solution. This allows us to efficiently evaluate these integrals, independently of the value of the multipole . In particular, this method significantly speeds up the evaluation of the angular bispectrum compared to existing methods. To illustrate our algorithm, we compute the galaxy, lensing and CMB temperature angular power spectrum and bispectrum.},

We update previous estimates by carrying a full exploration of the mock data likelihood for key fiducial models. We find that it will only be possible to exclude values of the sound speed very close to zero, while Planck data alone is not powerful enough for achieving any detection, even with lensing extraction. We also discuss the issue of initial conditions for dark energy perturbations in the radiation and matter epochs, generalizing the usual adiabatic conditions to include the sound speed effect. However, for most purposes, the existence of attractor solutions renders the perturbation evolution nearly independent of these initial conditions.},

  abstract = {Cosmological datasets have great potential to elucidate the nature of dark energy and test gravity on the largest scales available to observation. Theoretical predictions can be computed with hi\_class (www.hiclass-code.net), an accurate, fast and flexible code for linear cosmology, incorporating a wide range of dark energy theories and modifications to general relativity. We introduce three new functionalities into hi\_class: (1) Support for models based on covariant Lagrangians, including a constraint-preserving integration scheme for the background evolution and a series of worked-out examples: Galileon, nKGB, quintessence (monomial, tracker) and Brans-Dicke. (2) Consistent initial conditions for the scalar-field perturbations in the deep radiation era, identifying the conditions under which modified-gravity isocurvature perturbations may grow faster than adiabatic modes leading to a loss of predictivity. (3) An automated quasistatic approximation scheme allowing order-of-magnitude improvement in computing performance without sacrificing accuracy for wide classes of models. These enhancements bring the treatment of dark energy and modified gravity models to the level of detail comparable to software tools restricted to standard {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmologies. The hi\_class code is publicly available (https://github.com/miguelzuma/hi\_class\_public), ready to explore current data and prepare for next-generation experiments.},

We describe here the three approximations used by CLASS for basic LambdaCDM models, namely: a baryon-photon tight-coupling approximation which can be set to first order, second order or to a compromise between the two; an ultra-relativistic fluid approximation which had not been implemented in public distributions before; and finally a radiation streaming approximation taking reionisation into account.},

In this paper, we summarize the current status of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM as a physical theory, and review investigations into possible alternatives along a number of different lines, with a particular focus on highlighting the most promising directions. While the fundamental problems are proving reluctant to yield, the study of alternative cosmologies has led to considerable progress, with much more to come if hopes about forthcoming high-precision observations and new theoretical ideas are fulfilled.},

  abstract = {We present jax-cosmo, a library for automatically differentiable cosmological theory calculations. It uses the JAX library, which has created a new coding ecosystem, especially in probabilistic programming. As well as batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and automatic optimization of code for different hardware modalities (CPU, GPU, TPU), JAX exposes an automatic differentiation (autodiff) mechanism. Thanks to autodiff, jax-cosmo gives access to the derivatives of cosmological likelihoods with respect to any of their parameters, and thus enables a range of powerful Bayesian inference algorithms, otherwise impractical in cosmology, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational Inference. In its initial release, jax-cosmo implements background evolution, linear and non-linear power spectra (using halofit or the Eisenstein and Hu transfer function), as well as angular power spectra with the Limber approximation for galaxy and weak lensing probes, all differentiable with respect to the cosmological parameters and their other inputs. We illustrate how autodiff can be a game-changer for common tasks involving Fisher matrix computations, or full posterior inference with gradient-based techniques. In particular, we show how Fisher matrices are now fast, exact, no longer require any fine tuning, and are themselves differentiable. Finally, using a Dark Energy Survey Year 1 3x2pt analysis as a benchmark, we demonstrate how jax-cosmo can be combined with Probabilistic Programming Languages to perform posterior inference with state-of-the-art algorithms including a No U-Turn Sampler, Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference,and Neural Transport HMC. We further demonstrate that Normalizing Flows using Neural Transport are a promising methodology for model validation in the early stages of analysis.},

These statistics involve calculating angular two-point correlation functions for the auto- and cross-correlations between galaxy clustering and weak lensing. The corresponding model is determined by integrating the product of the power spectrum and two highly-oscillating Bessel functions over three dimensions, which makes the evaluation particularly challenging. Typically, this difficulty is circumvented by employing the so-called Limber approximation, which is an important source of error. We present Blast.jl, an innovative and efficient algorithm for calculating angular power spectra without employing the Limber approximation or assuming a scale-dependent growth rate, based on the use of Chebyshev polynomials. The algorithm is compared with the publicly available beyond-Limber codes, whose performances were recently tested by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration in the N5K challenge. At similar accuracy, Blast.jl is {$\approx$} 10-15{\texttimes} faster than the winning method of the challenge, also showing excellent scaling with respect to various hyper-parameters.},

  abstract = {In this paper we refine the calculation of primordial helium recombination, accounting for several additional effects that were neglected or treated more approximately in previous studies. These include consideration of (i) time-dependent radiative transfer interaction between the 2{\textasciicircum}1 P\_1 - 1{\textasciicircum}1 S\_0 and 2{\textasciicircum}3 P\_1 - 1{\textasciicircum}1 S\_0 resonances; (ii) time-dependent radiative transfer for the partially overlapping n{\textasciicircum}1 P\_1 - 1{\textasciicircum}1 S\_0, n{\textasciicircum}1 D\_2 - 1{\textasciicircum}1 S\_0 and n{\textasciicircum}3 P\_1 - 1{\textasciicircum}1 S\_0 series with 3 {$<$}= n {$<$}= 10; (iii) electron scattering within a kernel approach. We also briefly discuss the effect of electron scattering and HI quadrupole lines on the recombination of hydrogen. Although the physics of all the considered processes is interesting and subtle, for the standard cosmology, with Y\_p {\textbackslash}sim 0.24, the overall correction to the ionization history during helium recombination with respect to the previous implementation of CosmoRec remains smaller than {\textbar}DeltaNe/Ne{\textbar} {\textbackslash}sim 0.05\%. The dominant improvement is caused by consistent inclusion of resonance scattering for the 2{\textasciicircum}1 P\_1 - 1{\textasciicircum}1 S\_0 resonance. For cosmologies with a large helium fraction, Y\_p {\textbackslash}sim 0.4, the difference reaches {\textbar}D N\_e/N\_e{\textbar}{\textbackslash}sim 0.22\% at z{\textbackslash}sim1800, however, the overall correction to the CMB power spectra is small, exceeding {\textbar}D C\_l/C\_l{\textbar} {\textbackslash}sim 0.05 \% only at l{$>\backslash$}sim 3000. In comparison to the current version of Recfast the difference reaches {\textbar}D C\_l/C\_l{\textbar}{\textbackslash}sim0.4\% at l{\textbackslash}sim 3000 for Y\_p {\textbackslash}sim 0.4, and also for the standard value Y\_p {\textbackslash}sim 0.24 we find differences {\textbar}DC\_l/C\_l{\textbar}{$>\backslash$}sim 0.1\% at l{\textbackslash}sim 2500. The new processes are now included by the cosmological recombination code CosmoRec and can be activated as needed for most settings without affecting its runtime significantly.},

Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, Scalar-Tensor, Einstein-Aether, and Bimetric theories, as well as TeVeS, f(R), general higher-order theories, Horava-Lifschitz gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions including Kaluza-Klein, Randall-Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole.},

  abstract = {Methods. We compare the accuracy of different algorithms predicting the nonlinear matter power spectrum for such models. We then validate several pipelines for Fisher matrix and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) forecasts, using different theory codes, algorithms for numerical derivatives, and assumptions concerning the non-linear cut-off scale. Results. The Euclid primary probes alone will reach a sensitivity of {$\sigma$}( m{$\nu$} = 60 meV) = 56 meV in the {$\Lambda$}CDM+ m{$\nu$} model, whereas the combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck is expected to achieve {$\sigma$}( m{$\nu$} ) = 23 meV and raise the evidence for a non-zero neutrino mass to at least the 2.6 {$\sigma$} level. This can be pushed to a 4 {$\sigma$} detection if future CMB data from LiteBIRD and CMB Stage-IV are included. In combination with Planck , Euclid will also deliver tight constraints on ‚àÜNeff {$<$} 0.144 (95\%CL) in the {$\Lambda$}CDM+ m{$\nu$} +Neff model, or ‚àÜNeff {$<$} 0.063 when future CMB data are included. When floating the dark energy parameters, we find that the sensitivity to Neff remains stable, while that to m{$\nu$} degrades at most by a factor two. Conclusions. This work illustrates the complementarity between the Euclid spectroscopic and imaging/photometric surveys and between Euclid and CMB constraints. Euclid will have a great potential for measuring the neutrino mass and excluding wellmotivated scenarios with additional relativistic particles.},

  abstract = {Abstract: We explore the 2013 Planck likelihood function with a high-precision multi-dimensional minimizer (Minuit). This allows a refinement of the {$\Lambda$}CDM best-fit solution with respect to previously-released results, and the construction of frequentist confidence intervals using profile likelihoods. The agreement with the cosmological results from the Bayesian framework is excellent, demonstrating the robustness of the Planck results to the statistical methodology. We investigate the inclusion of neutrino masses, where more significant differences may appear due to the non-Gaussian nature of the posterior mass distribution. By applying the Feldman--Cousins prescription, we again obtain results very similar to those of the Bayesian methodology. However, the profile-likelihood analysis of the CMB combination (Planck+WP+highL) reveals a minimum well within the unphysical negative-mass region. We show that inclusion of the Planck CMB-lensing information regularizes this issue, and provide a robust frequentist upper limit m{$\nu$} {$\leq$} 0.26 eV (95\% confidence) from the CMB+lensing+BAO data combination.},

  abstract = {Prior to recombination photons, electrons, and atomic nuclei rapidly scattered and behaved, almost, like a single tightly-coupled photon-baryon plasma. We investigate here the accuracy of the tight-coupling approximation commonly used to numerically evolve the baryon and photon perturbation equations at early times. By solving the exact perturbations equations with a stiff solver starting deep in the radiation-dominated epoch we find the level of inaccuracy introduced by resorting to the standard first-order tight-coupling approximation. We develop a new second-order approximation in the inverse Thomson opacity expansion and show that it closely tracks the full solution, at essentially no extra numerical cost. We find the bias on estimates of cosmological parameters introduced by the first-order approximation is, for most parameters, negligible. Finally, we show that our second-order approximation can be used to reduce the time needed to compute cosmic microwave background angular spectra by as much as {\textasciitilde}17\%.},

  abstract = {Cosmological Boltzmann codes are often used by researchers for calculating the CMB angular power spectra from different theoretical models, for cosmological parameter estimation, etc. Therefore, the accuracy of a Boltzmann code is of utmost importance. Different Markov Chain Monte Carlo based parameter estimation algorithms typically require 103 -104 iterations of Boltzmann code. This makes the time complexity of such codes another critical factor. In the last two decades, several Boltzmann packages, such as CMBFAST, CAMB, CMBEasy, CLASS etc., have been developed. In this paper, we present a new cosmological Boltzmann code, CMBAns, that can be used for accurate calculation of the CMB power spectrum. At present, CMBAns is developed for a flat background matrix. It is mostly written in the C language. However, we borrowed the concept of class from C++. This gives researchers the flexibility to develop their own independent package based on CMBAns, without an in-depth understanding of the source code. We also develop multiple stand-alone facilities which can be directly compiled and run on a given parameter set. In this paper, we discuss all the mathematical formulation, approximation schemes, integration methods etc., that are used in CMBAns. The package will be made available through github for public use in the near future.},

To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to z = 1.0. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to z = 1.7. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5), for the Ly-{$\alpha$} forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median z {$\approx$} 0.2. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

  abstract = {The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be an ultrasensitive radio telescope, built to further the understanding of the most important phenomena in the Universe, including some pertaining to the birth and eventual death of the Universe itself. Over the next few years, the SKA will make the transition from an early formative to a well-defined design. This paper outlines how the scientific challenges are translated into technical challenges, how the application of recent technology offers the potential of affordably meeting these challenges, and how the choices of technology will ultimately be made. The SKA will be an array of coherently connected antennas spread over an area about 3000 km in extent, with an aggregate antenna collecting area of up to 106 m 2 at centimeter and meter wavelengths. A key scientific requirement is the ability to carry out sensitive observations of the sky over large areas (surveys). The ldquosurvey speedrdquo of the SKA will be enabled by the application of the most up-to-date signal-processing technology available. The SKA science impact will be widely felt in astroparticle physics and cosmology, fundamental physics, galactic and extragalactic astronomy, solar system science, and astrobiology.},

We (re-)investigate the tight coupling approximation and obtain analytic formulae reaching up to the octupoles of photon intensity and polarization. This leads to accurate results reaching optimal precision, while still being simple. Damping rapid oscillations of small scale modes at later times, we simplify the integration of cosmological perturbations. We obtain analytic expressions for the photon density contrast and velocity as well as an estimate of the quadrupole from after last scattering until today. These analytic formulae hold well during re-ionization and are in fact negligible for realistic cosmological scenarios. However, they do extend the validity of our approach to models with very large optical depth to the last scattering surface.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines, such as economics, epidemiology, and biology, to extract meaning from sources of data while accounting for one's uncertainty. The key idea of probabilistic programming is to decouple inference and model specification, thus allowing the practitioner to approach their task at hand using Bayesian inference, without requiring extensive knowledge in programming or computational statistics. At the same time, the complexity of problem settings in which PPLs are employed is steadily increasing, both in terms of project size and model complexity, calling for more flexible and efficient systems.                            In this work, we describe               Turing.jl               , a general-purpose PPL, which is designed to be flexible, efficient, and easy to use.

  abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. We demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We showcase an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},

This module implements a fully differentiable solver for the linearised cosmological Einstein-Boltzmann equations in the JAX framework, and allows computing Jacobian matrices of all solver output with respect to all input parameters using automatic differentiation. This implies that along with the solution for a given set of parameters, the tangent hyperplane in parameter space is known as well, which is a key ingredient for cosmological inference and forecasting problems as well as for many other applications. We discuss our implementation and demonstrate that our solver agrees at the per-mille level with the existing non-differentiable solvers CAMB and CLASS, including massive neutrinos and a dark energy fluid with parameterised equation of state. We illustrate the dependence of various summary statistics in large-scale structure cosmology on model parameters using the differentiable solver, and finally demonstrate how it can be easily used for Fisher forecasting, with a forecast for Euclid as an example. Since the implementation is significantly shorter and more modular than existing solvers, we believe it will be more straightforward to extend our solver to include additional physics, such as additional dark energy and dark matter models, modified gravity, or other non-standard physics in the future.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {A total angular momentum representation simplifies the radiation transport problem for temperature and polarization anisotropy in the CMB. Scattering terms couple only the quadrupole moments of the distributions and each moment corresponds directly to the observable angular pattern on the sky. We develop and employ these techniques to study the general properties of anisotropy generation from scalar, vector and tensor perturbations to the metric and the matter, both in the cosmological fluids and from any seed perturbations (e.g. defects) that may be present. The simpler, more transparent form and derivation of the Boltzmann equations brings out the geometric and model-independent aspects of temperature and polarization anisotropy formation. Large angle scalar polarization provides a robust means to distinguish between isocurvature and adiabatic models for structure formation in principle. Vector modes have the unique property that the CMB polarization is dominated by magnetic type parity at small angles (a factor of 6 in power compared with 0 for the scalars and 8/13 for the tensors) and hence potentially distinguishable independent of the model for the seed. The tensor modes produce a different sign from the scalars and vectors for the temperature-polarization correlations at large angles. We explore conditions under which one perturbation type may dominate over the others including a detailed treatment of the photon-baryon fluid before recombination.},

  abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of {\textasciitilde}0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {$<$} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution {\textasciitilde}250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

For whatever analytical or numerical form of the phase-space distribution function, the optimal sampling in momentum space compatible with a given level of accuracy is automatically found by comparing quadrature methods. The perturbation integration is made even faster by switching to an approximate viscous fluid description inside the Hubble radius, which differs from previous approximations discussed in the literature. When adding one massive neutrino to the minimal cosmological model, CLASS becomes just 1.5 times slower, instead of about 5 times in other codes (for fixed accuracy requirements). We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by considering a few examples of standard or non-standard neutrinos, as well as warm dark matter models.},

We list a few tiny changes in CAMB which are necessary in order to reach such a level. Using the common limit of the two codes as a set of reference spectra, we derive precision settings corresponding to fixed levels of error in the computation of a CMB likelihood. We find that for a given precision level, CLASS is about 2.5 times faster than CAMB for computing the lensed CMB spectra of a LambdaCDM model.

It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\textasciitilde}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

  abstract = {Derivatives of differential equation solutions are commonly for parameter estimation, fitting neural differential equations, and as model diagnostics. However, with a litany of choices and a Cartesian product of potential methods, it can be difficult for practitioners to understand which method is likely to be the most effective on their particular application. In this manuscript we investigate the performance characteristics of Discrete Local Sensitivity Analysis implemented via Automatic Differentiation (DSAAD) against continuous adjoint sensitivity analysis. Non-stiff and stiff biological and pharmacometric models, including a PDE discretization, are used to quantify the performance of sensitivity analysis methods. Our benchmarks show that on small systems of ODEs (approximately \${$<$}100\$ parameters+ODEs), forward-mode DSAAD is more efficient than both reverse-mode and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to be more efficient than discrete adjoints and forward methods after crossing this size range. These comparative studies demonstrate a trade-off between memory usage and performance in the continuous adjoint methods that should be considered when choosing the technique, while numerically unstable backsolve techniques from the machine learning literature are demonstrated as unsuitable for most scientific models. The performance of adjoint methods is shown to be heavily tied to the reverse-mode AD method, with tape-based AD methods shown to be 2 orders of magnitude slower on nonlinear partial differential equations than static AD techniques. These results also demonstrate the applicability of DSAAD to differential-algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid differential equation systems, showcasing an ease of implementation advantage for DSAAD approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM+HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic initial conditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM+HDM models with neutrino mass densities \${\textbackslash}onu=0.2\$ and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM+HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination.

However, users should not be trusted to write good code. In this manuscript we describe ModelingToolkit (MTK), a symbolic equation-based modeling system which allows for composable transformations to generate stable, efficient, and parallelized model implementations. MTK blurs the lines of traditional symbolic computing by acting directly on a user's numerical code. We show the ability to apply graph algorithms for automatically parallelizing and performing index reduction on code written for differential-algebraic equation (DAE) solvers, "fixing" the performance and stability of the model without requiring any changes to on the user's part. We demonstrate how composable model transformations can be combined with automated data-driven surrogate generation techniques, allowing machine learning methods to generate accelerated approximate models within an acausal modeling framework. These reduced models are shown to outperform the Dymola Modelica compiler on an HVAC model by 590x at 3{\textbackslash}\% error. Together, this demonstrates MTK as a system for bringing the latest research in graph transformations directly to modeling applications.},

  abstract = {Derivatives play a critical role in computational statistics, examples being Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and the training of neural networks. Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, regionbased memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and finding optimal methods to perform higher-order differentiation.},

  abstract = {\${\textbackslash}texttt\{PyCosmo\}\$ is a Python-based framework for the fast computation of cosmological model predictions. One of its core features is the symbolic representation of the Einstein-Boltzmann system of equations. Efficient \${\textbackslash}texttt\{C/C++\}\$ code is generated from the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{SymPy\}\$ symbolic expressions making use of the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{sympy2c\}\$ package. This enables easy extensions of the equation system for the implementation of new cosmological models. We illustrate this with three extensions of the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PyCosmo\}\$ Boltzmann solver to include a dark energy component with a constant equation of state, massive neutrinos and a radiation streaming approximation. We describe the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PyCosmo\}\$ framework, highlighting new features, and the symbolic implementation of the new models. We compare the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PyCosmo\}\$ predictions for the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model extensions with \${\textbackslash}texttt\{CLASS\}\$, both in terms of accuracy and computational speed. We find a good agreement, to better than 0.1\% when using high-precision settings and a comparable computational speed.

We revisit this system of differential equations and present a detailed investigation of its mathematical properties. For this purpose, we focus on a simplified set of equations aimed at describing the broad features of the matter power spectrum. We first perform an eigenvalue analysis and study the onset of oscillations in the system signaled by the transition from real to complex eigenvalues. We then provide a stability criterion of different numerical schemes for this linear system and estimate the associated step-size. We elucidate the stiffness property of the Einstein-Boltzmann system and show how it can be characterized in terms of the eigenvalues. While the parameters of the system are time dependent making it non-autonomous, we define an adiabatic regime where the parameters vary slowly enough for the system to be quasi-autonomous. We summarize the different regimes of the system for these different criteria as function of wave number \$k\$ and scale factor \$a\$. We also provide a compendium of analytic solutions for all perturbation variables in 6 limits on the \$k\$-\$a\$ plane and express them explicitly in terms of initial conditions. These results are aimed to help the further development and testing of numerical cosmological Boltzmann solvers.},

  abstract = {The general qualitative behavior of linear, first-order density perturbations in a Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre cosmological model with radiation and matter has been known for some time in the various limiting situations. An exact quantitative calculation which traces the entire history of the density fluctuations is lacking because the usual approximations of a very short photon mean free path before plasma recombination, and a very long mean free path after, are inadequate. We present here results of the direct integration of the collision equation of the photon distribution function, which enable us to treat in detail the complicated regime of plasma recombination. Starting from an assumed initial power spectrum well before recombination, we obtain a final spectrum of density perturbations after recombination. The calculations are carried out for several general-relativity models and one scalar-tensor model. One can identify two characteristic masses in the final power spectrum: one is the mass within the Hubble radius ct at recombination, and the other results from the linear dissipation of the perturbations prior to recombination. Conceivably the first of these numbers is associated with the great rich clusters of galaxies, the second with the large galaxies. We compute also the expected residual irregularity in the radiation from the primeval fireball. If we assume that (1) the rich clusters formed from an initially adiabatic perturbation and (2) the fireball radiation has not been seriously perturbed after the epoch of recombination of the primeval plasma, then with an angular resolution of 1 minute of arc the rms fluctuation in antenna temperature should be at least bT/T = 0.00015.},

In addition to the well-studied \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ challenge of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM (the Hubble \$H\_0\$ tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude \$A\_L\$ anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the \$H\_0\$ tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant \${\textbackslash}alpha\$, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.},

We show how, using the automatic differentiation, batch evaluation and just-in-time compilation features of JAX, and running the inference pipeline on graphics processing units (GPUs), parameter estimation can be accelerated by orders of magnitude with advanced gradient-based sampling techniques. These can be used to efficiently explore high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those needed for the analysis of next-generation cosmological surveys. We showcase the accuracy and computational efficiency of CosmoPower-JAX on two simulated Stage IV configurations. We first consider a single survey performing a cosmic shear analysis totalling 37 model parameters. We validate the contours derived with CosmoPower-JAX and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler against those derived with a nested sampler and without emulators, obtaining a speed-up factor of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(10{\textasciicircum}3)\$. We then consider a combination of three Stage IV surveys, each performing a joint cosmic shear and galaxy clustering (3x2pt) analysis, for a total of 157 model parameters. Even with such a high-dimensional parameter space, CosmoPower-JAX provides converged posterior contours in 3 days, as opposed to the estimated 6 years required by standard methods.

  abstract = {We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing {$\Lambda$}CDM and a dynamical dark energy model (w0waCDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply unlikely to be feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.},

While our result is manifestly covariant and satisfies the Bianchi identities, we point out that this is not the case for the implementation of the seminal work by Ma and Bertschinger and in the existing Boltzmann codes. We also study the tight coupling approximation up to the second order without choosing any gauge using the covariant full baryon equations. We implement the improved baryon equations in a Boltzmann code and investigate the change in the estimate of cosmological parameters by performing an MCMC analysis. With the covariantly correct baryon equations of motion, we find 1\% deviation for the best fit values of the cosmological parameters that should be taken into account. While in this paper, we study the Lambda-CDM model only, our baryon equations can be easily implemented in other models and various modified gravity theories.},

  abstract = {As wide-field surveys yield ever more precise measurements, cosmology has entered a phase of high precision requiring highly accurate and fast theoretical predictions. At the heart of most cosmological model predictions is a numerical solution of the Einstein-Boltzmann equations governing the evolution of linear perturbations in the Universe. We present PyCosmo, a new Python-based framework to solve this set of equations using a special pur- pose solver based on symbolic manipulations, automatic generation of C++ code and sparsity optimisation. The code uses a consistency relation of the field equations to adapt the time step and does not rely on physical approximations for speed-up. After reviewing the system of first-order linear homogeneous differential equations to be solved, we describe the numerical scheme implemented in PyCosmo. We then compare the predictions and performance of the code for the computation of the transfer functions of cosmological perturbations and compare it to existing cosmological Boltzmann codes. We find that we achieve comparable execution times for comparable accuracies. While PyCosmo does not yet have all the features of other codes, our approach is complementary to existing cosmological Boltzmann solvers and can be used as an independent test of their numerical solutions. The symbolic representation of the Einstein-Boltzmann equation system in PyCosmo provides a convenient interface for implementing extended cosmological models. We also discuss how the PyCosmo framework can also be used as a general framework to compute cosmological quantities as well as observables for both interactive and high-performance batch jobs applications.

For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics.

  abstract = {Computer algebra systems play an important role in science as they facilitate the development of new theoretical models. The resulting symbolic equations are often implemented in a compiled programming language in order to provide fast and portable codes for practical applications. We describe sympy2c, a new Python package designed to bridge the gap between the symbolic development and the numerical implementation of a theoretical model. sympy2c translates symbolic equations implemented in the SymPy Python package to C/C++ code that is optimized using symbolic transformations. The resulting functions can be conveniently used as an extension module in Python. sympy2c is used within the PyCosmo Python package to solve the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, a large system of ODEs describing the evolution of linear perturbations in the Universe. After reviewing the functionalities and usage of sympy2c, we describe its implementation and optimization strategies. This includes, in particular, a novel approach to generate optimized ODE solvers making use of the sparsity of the symbolic Jacobian matrix. We demonstrate its performance using the Einstein-Boltzmann equations as a test case. sympy2c is widely applicable and may prove useful for various areas of computational physics. sympy2c is publicly available at https://cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab/sympy2c.html},

We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of 279 PS1 SN Ia (\$0.03 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.68\$) with useful distance estimates of SN Ia from SDSS, SNLS, various low-z and HST samples to form the largest combined sample of SN Ia consisting of a total of 1048 SN Ia ranging from \$0.01 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.3\$, which we call the `Pantheon Sample'. When combining Planck 2015 CMB measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m=0.307{\textbackslash}pm0.012\$ and \$w = -1.026{\textbackslash}pm0.041\$ for the wCDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: \$w0 = -1.007{\textbackslash}pm 0.089\$ and \$wa = -0.222 {\textbackslash}pm0.407\$ for the w0waCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of \$2{\textbackslash}times\$ in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SN Ia to measure dark energy.},

  abstract = {We present a refined treatment of H, He I, and He II recombination in the early Universe. The difference from previous calculations is that we use multi-level atoms and evolve the population of each level with redshift by including all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In this framework we follow several hundred atomic energy levels for H, He I, and He II combined. The main improvements of this method over previous recombination calculations are: (1) allowing excited atomic level populations to depart from an equilibrium distribution; (2) replacing the total recombination coefficient with recombination to and photoionization from each level directly at each redshift step; and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including the triplet and singlet states. We find that the ionization fraction x\_e = n\_e/n\_H is approximately 10\% smaller at redshifts {$<$}{\textasciitilde}800 than in previous calculations, due to the non-equilibrium of the excited states of H, which is caused by the strong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. In addition we find that He I recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations, and occurs only just before H recombination. These changes in turn can affect the predicted power spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few percent level. Other improvements such as including molecular and ionic species of H, including complete heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature, including collisional rates, and including feedback of the secondary spectral distortions on the radiation field, produce negligible change to x\_e. The lower x\_e at low z found in this work affects the abundances of H molecular and ionic species by 10-25\%. However this difference is probably not larger than other uncertainties in the reaction rates.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

  abstract = {One of the main unsolved problems of cosmology is how to maximize the extraction of information from nonlinear data. If the data are nonlinear the usual approach is to employ a sequence of statistics (N-point statistics, counting statistics of clusters, density peaks or voids etc.), along with the corresponding covariance matrices. However, this approach is computationally prohibitive and has not been shown to be exhaustive in terms of information content. Here we instead develop a hierarchical Bayesian approach, expanding the likelihood around the maximum posterior of linear modes, which we solve for using optimization methods. By integrating out the modes using perturbative expansion of the likelihood we construct an initial power spectrum estimator, which for a fixed forward model contains all the cosmological information if the initial modes are gaussian distributed. We develop a method to construct the window and covariance matrix such that the estimator is explicitly unbiased and nearly optimal. We then generalize the method to include the forward model parameters, including cosmological and nuisance parameters, and primordial non-gaussianity. We apply the method in the simplified context of nonlinear structure formation, using either simplified 2-LPT dynamics or N-body simulations as the nonlinear mapping between linear and nonlinear density, and 2-LPT dynamics in the optimization steps used to reconstruct the initial density modes. We demonstrate that the method gives an unbiased estimator of the initial power spectrum, providing among other a near optimal reconstruction of linear baryonic acoustic oscillations.},

It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

Because of the complexity of the codes delivering such predictions, reaching a high level of numerical accuracy is challenging. Among the codes already fulfilling this task, PyCosmo is a Python-based framework providing solutions to the Einstein-Boltzmann equations and accurate predictions for cosmological observables. In this work, we first describe how the observables are implemented. Then, we check the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for background quantities, power spectra and Limber and beyond-Limber angular power spectra by comparison with other codes: the Core Cosmology Library (CCL), CLASS, HMCode and iCosmo. In our analysis we quantify the agreement of PyCosmo with the other codes, for a range of cosmological models, monitored through a series of unit tests. PyCosmo, conceived as a multi-purpose cosmology calculation tool in Python, is designed to be interactive and user-friendly. A current version of the code (without the Boltzmann Solver) is publicly available and can be used interactively on the platform PyCosmo Hub, all accessible from this link: (https://cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab/PyCosmo. html).

SO will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands: 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes (SATs) and one large-aperture 6-m telescope (LAT), with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization. The SATs will target the largest angular scales observable from Chile, mapping {\textasciitilde}10\% of the sky to a white noise level of 2 \${\textbackslash}mu\$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, \$r\$, at a target level of \${\textbackslash}sigma(r)=0.003\$. The LAT will map {\textasciitilde}40\% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected white noise level of 6 \${\textbackslash}mu\$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, overlapping with the majority of the LSST sky region and partially with DESI. With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000 extragalactic sources.},

In this manuscript we developed a set of parallelized ODE solvers using extrapolation methods which exploit ``parallelism within the method'' so that arbitrary user ODEs can be parallelized. We describe the specific choices made in the implementation of the explicit and implicit extrapolation methods which allow for generating low overhead static schedules to then exploit with optimized multithreaded implementations. We demonstrate that while the multithreading gives a noticeable acceleration on both explicit and implicit problems, the explicit parallel extrapolation methods gave no significant improvement over state-of-the-art even with a multi-threading advantage against current optimized high order Runge-Kutta tableaus. However, we demonstrate that the implicit parallel extrapolation methods are able to achieve state-of-theart performance (2x-4x) on standard multicore x86 CPUs for systems of {$<$} 200 stiff ODEs solved at low tolerance, a typical setup for a vast majority of users of high level language equation solver suites. The resulting method is distributed as the first widely available open source software for within-method parallel acceleration targeting typical modest compute architectures.},

  abstract = {The advent of large data-set in cosmology has meant that in the past 10 or 20 years our knowledge and understanding of the Universe has changed not only quantitatively but also, and most importantly, qualitatively. Cosmologists are interested in studying the origin and evolution of the physical Universe. They rely on data where a host of useful information is enclosed, but is encoded in a non-trivial way. The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome to make the most of the large experimental effort. Even after having analyzed a decade or more of data and having converged to a standard cosmological model (the so-called and highly successful LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this model is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study deviations from the standard model the number of parameters is even larger. Dealing with such a high dimensional parameter space and finding parameters constraints is a challenge on itself. In addition, as gathering data is such an expensive and difficult process, cosmologists want to be able to compare and combine different data sets both for testing for possible disagreements (which could indicate new physics) and for improving parameter determinations. Finally, always because experiments are so expansive, cosmologists in many cases want to find out a priori, before actually doing the experiment, how much one would be able to learn from it. For all these reasons, more and more sophisiticated statistical techniques are being employed in cosmology, and it has become crucial to know some statistical background to understand recent literature in the field. Here, I will introduce some statistical tools that any cosmologist should know about in order to be able to understand recently published results from the analysis of cosmological data sets. I will not present a complete and rigorous introduction to statistics as there are several good books which are reported in the references. The reader should refer to those. I will take a practical approach and I will touch upon useful tools such as statistical inference, Bayesians vs Frequentist approach, chisquare and goodness of fit, confidence regions, likelihood, Fisher matrix approach, Monte Carlo methods and a brief introduction to model testing.},

  abstract = {We present a comparison of Fisher matrix forecasts for cosmological probes with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) posterior likelihood estimation methods. We analyse the performance of future Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) stage-III and stageIV dark-energy surveys using supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing as probes. We concentrate in particular on the dark-energy equation of state parameters w0 and wa. For purely geometrical probes, and especially when marginalising over wa, we find considerable disagreement between the two methods, since in this case the Fisher matrix can not reproduce the highly non-elliptical shape of the likelihood function. More quantitatively, the Fisher method underestimates the marginalized errors for purely geometrical probes between 30\%-70\%. For cases including structure formation such as weak lensing, we find that the posterior probability contours from the Fisher matrix estimation are in good agreement with the MCMC contours and the forecasted errors only changing on the 5\% level. We then explore non-linear transformations resulting in physically-motivated parameters and investigate whether these parameterisations exhibit a Gaussian behaviour. We conclude that for the purely geometrical probes and, more generally, in cases where it is not known whether the likelihood is close to Gaussian, the Fisher matrix is not the appropriate tool to produce reliable forecasts.},

  abstract = {The major theoretical limitation for extracting cosmological parameters from the CMB sky lies in the precision with which we can calculate the cosmological recombination process. Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium recombination could effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the cosmological parameters derived from the Planck satellite, for example. Here we modify the cosmological recombination code RECFAST by introducing one more parameter to reproduce the recent numerical results for the speed-up of the helium recombination. Together with the existing hydrogen fudge factor, we vary these two parameters to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological recombination. By using the CosmoMC code with Planck forecast data, we find that we need to determine the parameters to better than ten per cent for He I and one per cent for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological parameters. For helium recombination, if the existing studies have calculated the ionization fraction to the 0.1 per cent level by properly including the relevant physical processes, then we already have numerical calculations which are accurate enough for Planck. For hydrogen, setting the fudge factor to speed up low redshift recombination by 14 per cent appears to be sufficient for Planck. However, more work still needs to be done to carry out comprehensive numerical calculations of all the relevant effects for hydrogen, as well as to check for effects which couple hydrogen and helium recombinaton through the radiation field.},
